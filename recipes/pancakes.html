        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Pancakes are a versatile breakfast food enjoyed worldwide, with various 
            regional interpretations. They are typically made from a mixture of flour, 
            eggs, milk, and other ingredients, which form a batter that is cooked on a 
            griddle or pan. The texture and flavor of pancakes can vary significantly 
            depending on the ingredients used. For example, American-style pancakes are 
            often thick and fluffy, while French crêpes are thin and delicate. In many 
            cultures, pancakes are not just a breakfast item but also a part of cultural 
            traditions and celebrations, such as Shrove Tuesday in the UK or La Chandeleur 
            in France.</p>

        <p>The origins of pancakes are ancient and widespread, with evidence of pancake-like 
            dishes found in many cultures. In Europe, pancakes have been a staple for centuries, 
            often served as a way to use up ingredients before fasting periods like Lent. 
            The modern pancake has evolved with the introduction of new ingredients and cooking 
            techniques, such as the use of baking powder to create lighter, fluffier pancakes. 
            Around the world, pancakes take on diverse forms, from the savory Vietnamese bánh xèo 
            to the sweet Japanese soufflé pancakes, each reflecting local tastes and traditions.</p>
            
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>    
        <ul>
            <li>1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour</li>

            <li>3 1/2 teaspoons baking powder</li>

            <li>1 tablespoon white sugar</li>

            <li>1/4 teaspoon salt, or more to taste</li>
            
            <li>1 1/4 cups milk</li>

            <li>3 tablespoons butter, melted</li>

            <li>1 large egg</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Sift flour, baking powder, sugar, and salt together in a large bowl. 
                Make a well in the center and add milk, melted butter, and egg; mix 
                until smooth.</li>
            <li>Heat a lightly oiled griddle or pan over medium-high heat. Pour or 
                scoop the batter onto the griddle, using approximately 1/4 cup for 
                each pancake; cook until bubbles form and the edges are dry, about 
                2 to 3 minutes. Flip and cook until browned on the other side. 
                Repeat with remaining batter.</li>
        </ol>
