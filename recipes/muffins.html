        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Chocolate chip muffins are a beloved variation of the classic muffin, 
            known for their rich, sweet flavor and the delightful surprise of melted 
            chocolate chips within. They are made with a similar quick bread batter 
            as other muffins but include the addition of chocolate chips, which add 
            both flavor and texture. The combination of the moist, slightly dense muffin 
            and the gooey chocolate creates a treat that is both comforting and indulgent. 
            Chocolate chip muffins are often enjoyed as a breakfast item, snack, or dessert, 
            and they are a staple in many bakeries and cafes.</p>

        <p>The origins of chocolate chip muffins are closely tied to the invention of 
            chocolate chips themselves. Ruth Wakefield, an American chef, is credited 
            with accidentally inventing chocolate chip cookies in 1937 when she added 
            chopped bits of chocolate to her cookie dough, expecting them to melt and 
            distribute evenly. However, the chocolate retained its shape, creating a 
            delightful surprise. This innovation soon influenced other baked goods, 
            including muffins. The addition of chocolate chips to muffin batter became 
            popular in the mid-20th century, as it provided a convenient way to incorporate 
            chocolate into a quick and easy-to-make breakfast or snack item. Today, chocolate 
            chip muffins remain a favorite among both children and adults, offering a sweet 
            treat that combines the warmth of a freshly baked muffin with the indulgence of 
            chocolate.</p>
