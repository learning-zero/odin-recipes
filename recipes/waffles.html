        <h2>Description</h2>
        <div class="description">
            <p>Waffles are a popular breakfast or brunch food made from a leavened 
            batter or dough cooked between two patterned plates, giving them a 
            characteristic size, shape, and surface impression. The history of 
            waffles dates back to ancient Greece, where flat cakes called obleios 
            were cooked between hot metal plates. These early cakes evolved into wafers 
            during the Middle Ages, becoming a staple across Europe. Over time, wafers 
            were enhanced with various ingredients like spices and leavening agents, 
            gradually transforming into the waffles we know today.</p>

            <p>The modern waffle gained its name in the English language in 1725, derived 
            from the Dutch wafel. The Netherlands and Belgium played significant 
            roles in shaping the modern waffle, with the Dutch introducing rectangular 
            plates and the Belgians developing iconic varieties like the Li√®ge and 
            Brussels waffles. Waffles were introduced to America by Dutch immigrants 
            and gained widespread popularity after being showcased at international 
            fairs in the mid-20th century. Today, waffles are enjoyed worldwide in 
            numerous regional variations, reflecting their rich culinary history and 
            versatility.</p>
