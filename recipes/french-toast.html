        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>French toast is a beloved breakfast dish made by dipping slices of bread 
            in a mixture of eggs, milk, and often spices like cinnamon, before frying 
            them in a pan until golden brown. It is typically served with sweet toppings 
            such as maple syrup, butter, and powdered sugar, though savory versions 
            exist as well. The dish has a long history, with early versions dating back to 
            ancient Rome, where a similar dish called "Pan Dulcis" was enjoyed. In France, 
            it is known as "pain perdu," meaning "lost bread," because it was originally 
            made with stale bread to prevent waste.</p>

        <p>The name "French toast" was first used in 17th-century England, and the recipe 
            was brought to America by early settlers. Over time, French toast has evolved 
            with various cultural interpretations. In the United States, it is often served 
            with sweet toppings, while in other countries, it may be served differently, 
            such as with ketchup in the UK or bananas and bacon in New Zealand. French toast 
            remains a versatile and popular dish, celebrated for its ability to transform 
            stale bread into a delicious treat</p>
